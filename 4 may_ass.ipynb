    "A time series is a sequence of data points collected and recorded at regular intervals over time. It represents the evolution of a variable or phenomenon of interest over a specific period.

    "Trend: A trend represents a long-term systematic change in the mean of the time series over time. It can be upward (positive trend) or downward (negative trend).

    "data:\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling Missing Values: Missing values can occur in time series data due to various reasons such as sensor failures, data collection issues, or gaps in recording. Missing\n",
    "values need to be handled before analysis. Depending on the situation, missing values can be imputed using techniques like forward filling, backward filling, mean \n",
    "imputation, or interpolation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling Outliers: Outliers are extreme values that deviate significantly from the normal behavior of the time series. Outliers can distort the analysis and modeling \n",
    "results. They should be identified and treated appropriately. Outliers can be detected using statistical methods such as z-score, median absolute deviation, or box plots, \n",
    "and then can be handled through methods like trimming, Winsorization, or replacing with a more reasonable value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Resampling and Aggregating: Time series data may be recorded at different time intervals, which can make analysis challenging. Resampling involves changing the frequency \n",
    "of the data to a higher or lower frequency. For example, data recorded at an hourly interval can be resampled to daily or weekly intervals. Aggregating data within specific\n",
    "time intervals (e.g., sum, average) can also be done to reduce noise or focus on higher-level patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformations: Data transformations can be applied to stabilize the variance or make the data more suitable for analysis. Common transformations include logarithmic\n",
    "transformation, square root transformation, or Box-Cox transformation. These transformations can help in handling heteroscedasticity or non-normality in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stationarity: Many time series analysis techniques, such as ARIMA models, assume that the data is stationary, meaning the statistical properties do not change over time.\n",
    "If the time series is non-stationary (exhibiting trends or seasonality), it may need to be transformed to achieve stationarity. Techniques like differencing or seasonal\n",
    "differencing can be applied to remove trends or seasonality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scaling and Normalization: Scaling or normalizing the data can be beneficial, especially when dealing with multiple time series with different scales. Scaling ensures that \n",
    "all variables are on a similar scale, making comparisons and modeling more reliable. Common scaling techniques include min-max scaling, z-score normalization, or \n",
    "logarithmic scaling.\n",
    "\n",
